<h1>who and who came</h1>
Grandfather jahwoe RAA Nyegbla came to anloga in 1865. He is called by bokonorga Doe Akonu who is from the tovie clan. Doe Akonu travelled from nortsie to Keteklebi. Anloga.
He passed through  many places and finally passed through Tegbi before coming to the present day anloga.
He was told by his oracle to call the following people who were our grandparents.
The people are 
Ashiapim 
Kabutey
Asimasine (LE)

<h1>who ask them to come</h1>
He asked them to fight against the people of Ada at atorkor, wuti and srorgboe
Because they do not allowed Keteklebi people to be fishing in their water territories at Azizanu(estuary)
Before that, Torgbi Deladzea, Torgbi  Amesimeku and Torgbi Dordi sent to them these items accordingly.

<h1>what do they bring along?</h1>
Torgbi Deladzea ………………………… gbadzagoli <br>
Torgbi  Amesimeku …………………… Ade3kpui (sword) and  <br>
Torgbi Dordi ……………………………… Alornuga <br>

<h1>where were they before?</h1>
Jahwoe Raa Nyegbla and his sons were at Gbogbla NigoPrampam

<h1>what do they come to do?</h1>
When he came, he defeated the people of Ada for the people of Anlo .
Making the Anlo people free to fish in the river Volta estuary. it was Tamekloe and Sorkpor who went to Azizanu and suppress the Ada people in a curse which enable the Anlo people to defeat the Ada  people.
On 6th march 1866, when another war broke out , Raa Nyegbla again defeated the people at Datsutagba war. He was given Mama Adesu deity to him for a wife.
Later on Tettevi Amivor took  the wife Awusuto his home and told the people of enlo that  he has taken  Nyigbla with him.
Tamekloe further  decided to move back to the Kwamufie his former home town.
Here is the history of  Jahwoe RAA Nyegbla.
Thanks
