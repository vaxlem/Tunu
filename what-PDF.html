History of the coming of jawoe (RAA Nyegbla) to Keteklebi (ANLOGA)
Grandfather jahwoe RAA Nyegbla came to anloga in 1865. He is called by bokonorga Doe Akonu who is from the tovie clan. Doe Akonu travelled from nortsie to Keteklebi. Anloga.
He passed through  many places and finally passed through Tegbi before coming to the present day anloga.
He was told by his oracle to call the following people who were our grandparents.
The people are 
Ahiapim 
Kabutey
Asimasine (LE)
He asked them to fight against the people of Ada at atorkor, wuti and srorgboe
Because they do not allowed Keteklebi people to be fishing in their water territories at Azizanu(estuary)
Before that, Torgbi Deladzea, Torgbi  Amesimeku and Torgbi Dordi sent to them these items accordingly.
Torgbi Deladzea ………………………… gbadzagoli
 Torgbi  Amesimeku …………………… Ade3kpui (sword) and
Torgbi Dordi ……………………………… Alornuga
Jahwoe Raa Nyegbla and his sons were at Gbogbla NigoPrampam
When they were called to Keteklebi – Anloga in the 1865 war.
When he came, he defeated the people of Ada for the people of Anlo .
Making the Anlo people free to fish in the river Volta estuary. it was Tamekloe and Sorkpor who went to Azizanu and suppress the Ada people in a curse which enable the Anlo people to defeat the Ada  people.
On 6th march 1866, when another war broke out , Raa Nyegbla again defeated the people at Datsutagba war. He was given Mama Adesu deity to him for a wife.
Later on Tettevi Amivor took  the wife Awusuto his home and told the people of enlo that  he has taken  Nyigbla with him.
Tamekloe further  decided to move back to the Kwamufie his former home town.
But the people of Anlo however	 denied his leaving. Kukpo went to Sri Kofi Hayibor Aziza Kwakume came onto the throne. This king told his priest –Agortsimevi Kugblenu to stop using the white cloth because he shall also stop using ‘Agagadama ade wu’ dodo. 
He too obeyed this command and staeted to use “BISI” cloth which was not allowed in Jahwoe RAA Nyegbla house.
Our chiefs mamma wo and the people of Anlo (Keteklebi) here is the history of  Jahwoe RAA Nyegbla.
Thanks
Asiapim Nyegbla
