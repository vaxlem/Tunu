            My inlaw lakle who is a king of Kpalime, gave me the name Lakle.



    One-day, the Tsiame clan members in person of Dzeble Kwaku commit a sin against the deity Nyegbla. At that time, the priest on nyegbla's stool was EHA ASHIAPIM -1ST.
    The SIN was that, when Ashiapim Eha I, went to greet his priest Amedor Kpegla Bate VI, the Awoamefia of Anlo, Dzeble  Kwaku slapped him. This invoke a curse on the tsiame clan.
    <br>
    Years later, A war broke out at Agbeluwoe- a town in which Dzeble Kwaku had gone to trade with the inhabitants. To save their lives, Dzikunu, Nyamadi, Tamekloe and Banini took to their heels and came to Anloga. When they came they reported to the family and the wife of Dzeble Kwaku [Awagashie], that he had been killed in the war. This was a total fabrication because Dzeble Kwaku was not killed as they claimed (came to tell).
            At first the family believed the death news of their beloved one. Therefore they made his elder brother Ahafia to marry his (Dzeble Kwaku) wife Awagasi Lakle. Not long after marring to the woman, Dzeble Kwaku –the supposed dead return with human heads from the war. This was alarming and caused panic.
            Awagasi Lakle however run to the father at Kpalime upon realizing that the husband- Dzeble Kwaku is still alive. Meanwhile during that period she was pregnant for AHAFIA DRAKI (the big brother of Dzeble Kwaku). She does not believe the incidence happening in her life and as regard to her pregnancy. Due to that she had named the baby she borne ‘Dzeble Kwaku Megbenya ko woanye’ (MEGBENYA in short). This name means what she was going through can only happen in the absence of Dzeble Kwaku.
            When Mamma Megbenya was born, she was taken as a reparation on behalf of the Tsiame Clan, to the deity Nyegbla. The priest of the Nyegbla at that time was, Priest Eha Ashiapim l. Eha however betrothed her to his son Tay. Soon after the marriage to Tay, the Awoamefia of kpalime came to Anlo and thanked the priest – father of TAY (Megbenya’s husband). 
            
            Because of the marriage to his grand-daughter, and he-Kpalime King Lakle (Megbenya’s grandpa) declared End of War between the inhabitants of Anlos and his people. As a symbol, he gave his royal name “LAKLE” to Tay Eha (who is now his grandson in-law) that is known as Lakle Dormegbaba. 
            Appellatively hailed – Lakle Dormegbaba be ye dami wu gbor (the port-belly leopard/ panther which says he’s fatter than goat). 
            The marriage of TAY LAKLE EHA to MEGBENYA however, enable the descendants of EHA ASHIAPIM to obtain land from the family of Amedor Kpeglah - the Bate king.
