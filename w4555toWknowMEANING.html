En y allant, il a posé son piège en fixant un fusil sur le chemin où les bêtes se déplacent ou passent quand elles errent. Après avoir réglé son fusil, il grimperait dans un arbre et, à l'aide d'une corde, il tirerait la gâchette du fusil qu'il avait posé sur le sol sur les animaux depuis le sommet de l'arbre. <br> Il compléterait ensuite la mise à mort en tirant d'autres fusils et munitions qu'il avait avec lui au sommet de l'arbre. En peu de temps, tous les animaux dangereux, y compris les lions, ne dérangeaient plus, ils étaient éliminés. Cette bravoure a étonné tous les autres chasseurs et les gens car ils ont essayé en vain et ils se demandent comment il a fait. Par conséquent, ils lui demanderaient comment il a fait. <br> Et fièrement, Preku dirait (' Afisia la, Etunue wonye.'). Pour dire, '<i>cet endroit, c'est une bouche d'un fusil.

Selon les récits, les habitants d'Ada étaient des pêcheurs. Mais ce n'est pas tout ; ils faisaient aussi de l'agriculture et du commerce avec les habitants d'Anlo de l'autre côté de la rivière Volta. À un moment donné, plusieurs d'entre eux se sont lancés dans la récolte de vin de palme. Voici ce qui s'est passé. La région de collecte a été découverte par les dirigeants du clan Klevie, un clan d'Anlo. Cela s'étendait jusqu'à Fuveme (Azizanu) et jusqu'à Dzita et au-delà.</p>"+
        "<br> Au fil du temps, les membres du clan Klevie ont donné des portions de la zone de collecte aux gens d'Ada et pendant un certain temps, ces résidents d'Ada ont planté des palmiers sur le site et ont utilisé pour récolter et brasser du vin à partir de la plantation de palmiers. <br>  Puis tout à coup, ils ont remarqué un vol de leur vin et ont accusé les gens du clan Klevi de voler leur vin.  En conséquence, ils ont utilisé leur divinité pour jeter un sort au clan Klevi. La situation est devenue tendue, donc, cela a pris un autre clan (<i class='p'>clan BATEH</i>) membres/anciens pour payer au nom du clan Klevi. Les gens de Klevie ont transféré la terre au clan Bateh à la suite de cette gentillesse du clan Bateh. Cet événement illustre comment les gens de Bateh contrôlent la zone de collecte. Plus tard, les animaux sauvages de la forêt ont posé problème, et lorsque cela est devenu important, la décision a été prise de les éliminer. Ainsi, un homme nommé <u>Agbahnyo</u> du peuple Bateh a sollicité le soutien de vaillants guerriers pour l'aider à exterminer les animaux sauvages. À ce stade, un chasseur de Srogboe-Wuti s'est approché et a proposé de faire le travail. <u class='p'>LAKLEH TAY EHA</u> était le nom de cet individu.</p><br>"+

Donc, Preku a été envoyé par son partenaire Lakleh pour partir en expédition de chasse. En y allant, il a posé son piège en fixant un fusil sur le chemin où les bêtes se déplacent ou passent quand elles errent. Après avoir réglé son fusil, il grimperait dans un arbre et, à l'aide d'une corde, il tirerait la gâchette du fusil qu'il avait posé sur le sol sur les animaux depuis le sommet de l'arbre. <br> Il compléterait ensuite la mise à mort en tirant d'autres fusils et munitions qu'il avait avec lui au sommet de l'arbre. En peu de temps, tous les animaux dangereux, y compris les lions, ne dérangeaient plus, ils étaient éliminés. Cette bravoure a étonné tous les autres chasseurs et les gens car ils ont essayé en vain et ils se demandent comment il a fait. Par conséquent, ils lui demanderaient comment il a fait. <br> Et fièrement, Preku dirait (' Afisia la, Etunue wonye.'). Pour dire, '<i>cet endroit, c'est une bouche d'un fusil. Quand on essaie, on meurt.</i>' <br>Cette renommée a naturellement donné naissance au nom célèbre <span >Tunu.</span> <br> (à la bouche et au canon d'un fusil.)</P>"+
