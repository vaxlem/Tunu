<h1>THE MAN LAKLE TAY EHA </h1>
      <!-- <p>LONG ago, in the 17th century, there lived a family of 12 strong men in Ada, in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. <br> The names of some of them are: <br> Ashiapim,<br> Kabutey and <br> Asimasinne (also known as LE). <br> The following people are their relatives. These are: the Ocanseys, the Kubis, the Shamateys among others.</p><br> -->
      I am  TAY EHA - Lakle. Your nearest greater grandfather. The other great grandparents live in Ada - where my parents came from to ANLO-land.
      <p>The name of my Father is EHA ASHIAPIM - 1st, (Priest Eha Ashiapim 1), the son of the oldman called ASHIAPIM from Ada, who happen to be a chief priest to NYEGBLA, in ANLO-land during those days i was born. My mother is Mama Edzortsa from Srogboe (Kpatamia house). I have a step mother called Aba Kukpo, who gave birth to my step-brothers such as Gagba and siblings at Avume Gagbakorpeh.  </p>(DO YOU KNOW MY REAL NAME?) OH! Ok. My real name is TAY EHA. 
        So, Lakle is not the name my parents gave me. (do you want me to tell you how i got that name? don't worry i shall tell you soon.) I married to a beautiful <a href="#" style="color: tomato;"> Tsiame</a> - woman called <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #c6eb0a;">MEGBENYA HAFIA DZRAKI</span> from Anloga.
        It is because of this woman that i got the name LAKLE. My great-inlaw (called Lakle), who is a king of Kpalime, gave me the name <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lakle.</span> <br> <br>
                 <br>
      <h2> LAKLE DORMEGBABA, BE YE DA AMI WU Gbor. (LAKLE RIKUU, Ebe ye me nye Gbor deami gbor nu o). <!-- (LAKLE RIKUU, Ebeyemeney Gbor deami gbor nu o) --> meaning, the port-belly leopard or panther which says he is fatter than goat, a lean panther which says he is no where equal to a fatty goat. One day, the Tsiame clan members in person of Dzeble Kwaku commit a sin against the deity Nyegbla. At that time, the priest on nyegbla's stool was EHA ASHIAPIM-1ST. <br>
        The SIN was that, when Ashiapim Eha-1st, went to greet his priest Amedor Kpegla Bate VI, the Awoamefia of Anlo, Dzeble  Kwaku slapped him. This invoke a curse on the tsiame clan.
<br><div style="margin: 30px 0px;"> Years later, A war broke out at Agbeluwoe- a town in which Dzeble Kwaku had gone to trade with the inhabitants. To save their lives, Dzikunu, Nyamadie, Tamekloe and Baninie took to their heels and came to Anloga. When they came they reported to the family and the wife of Dzeble Kwaku [Awagashie], that he had been killed in the war. This was a total fabrication because Dzeble Kwaku was not killed as they claimed (or came to tell).
        At first, the family believed the death news of their beloved one. Therefore they made his elder brother Ahafia to marry his (Dzeble Kwakus) wife  (Awagasi) Lakle. Not long after marrying to the woman, Dzeble Kwaku – the supposed dead return with human heads from the war. This was alarming and caused panic.
        Awagasi Lakle however run to the father at Kpalime upon realizing that the husband- Dzeble Kwaku is still alive. Meanwhile during that period she was pregnant for HAFIA DRAKI (the big brother of Dzeble Kwaku). She does not believe the incidence happening in her life and as regard to her pregnancy. Due to that she had named the baby she borne ‘Dzeble Kwaku Megbenya ko woanye’ (MEGBENYA in short). This name means what she was going through can only happen in the absence of Dzeble Kwaku.
        When Mamma Megbenya was born, she was taken as a reparation on behalf of the Tsiame Clan, to the deity Nyegbla. The priest of the Nyegbla at that time was, Priest Eha Ashiapim-1st. Eha however betrothed her to his son Tay. Soon after the marriage to Tay, the Awoamefia of kpalime came to Anlo and thanked the priest – father of TAY (Megbenya’s husband).<br>Because of the marriage to his grand-daughter, and he - Kpalime King Lakle (Megbenya’s grandpa) declared End of War between the inhabitants of Anlos and his people. As a symbol, he gave his royal name “LAKLE” to Tay Eha (who is now his grandson in-law) that is known as Lakle Dormegbaba. 
        Appellatively hailed – Lakle Dormegbaba be ye dami wu gbor (the port-belly leopard or panther which says he’s fatter than goat). 
        The marriage of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TAY LAKLE EHA </span>to <span style="color: #c6eb0a;"> Megbenya</span> however, enable Tay to own LAKLE, and also resulted in the descendants of EHA ASHIAPIM to obtain land from the family of Amedor Kpeglah - the Bate king as well as land from the Tovie Clan.
