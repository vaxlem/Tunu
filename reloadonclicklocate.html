    Chilren, I am TAY EHA Lakle. Your nearest greater grandfather. The other great grandparents live in Ada - where my parents came from to ANLO-land. The name of my Father is Eha Ashiapim - 1st, ( Priest Eha Ashiapim 1 ), the son of the oldman called ashiapim from Ada, who happen to be a chief priest to nyegbla, in ANLO-land during those days i was born. My mother is Mama Edzortsa from Srogboe (Kpatamia house). I have a step mother called Aba Kukpo, who gave birth to my step-brothers such as Gagba and siblings at Avume Gagbakorpeh. (DO YOU KNOW MY REAL NAME?) OH! Ok. My real name is TAY EHA. So, Lakle is not the name my parents gave me. (do you want me to tell you how i got that name? dont worry i shall tell you soon.) I married to a beautiful woman called MEGBENYA HAFIA DZRAKI from Anloga. It is because of this woman that i got the name LAKLE. Thus, My inlaw (called Lakle), who is a king of Kpalime, gave me the name. LAKLE DORMEGBABA DIKUU, BE YE DA AMI WU Gbor. Ebe ye me nye Gbor deami gbor nu o. One day, the Tsiame clan members in person of Dzeble Kwaku commit a sin against the deity Nyegbla. At that time, the priest on nyegblas stool was EHA ASHIAPIM-1ST. The SIN was that, when Ashiapim Eha-1st, went to greet his priest Amedor Kpegla Bate VI, the Awoamefia of Anlo, Dzeble  Kwaku slapped him. This invoked a curse on the Tsiame clan. Years later, A war broke out at Agbeluwoe a town in which Dzeble Kwaku had gone to trade with the inhabitants. To save their lives, Dzikunu, Nyamadrie, Tamekloe and Baninie took to their heels and came to Anloga. When they came, they reported to the family and the wife of Dzeble Kwaku [Awagashie], that he had been killed in the war. This was a total fabrication because Dzeble Kwaku was not killed as they claimed (or came to tell). At first, the family believed the death news of their beloved one. Therefore they made Hafia his elder brother, to marry his (Dzeble Kwaku) wife Awagasi Lakle. Not long after marrying to the woman, Dzeble Kwaku the supposed dead return with human heads from the war. This was alarming and caused panic. Awagasi Lakle however, run to the father at Kpalime upon realizing that the husband Dzeble Kwaku is still alive. Meanwhile during that period she was pregnant for HAFIA DRAKI (the big brother of Dzeble Kwaku). She does not believe the incidence happening in her life and as regard to her pregnancy. Due to that she had named the baby she borne Dzeble Kwaku Megbenya ko woanye (MEGBENYA in short). This name means what she was going through can only happen in the absence of Dzeble Kwaku. Now the Tsiame clan need to solve their curse on them. When Mamma Megbenya was born, she was taken to the deity Nyegbla, as a reparation on behalf of the Tsiame Clan. The priest of the Nyegbla at that time was, Priest Eha Ashiapim-1st. Eha however betrothed her to his son Tay. Soon after the marriage to Tay, the Awoamefia of kpalime came to Anlo and thanked the . Em, father of TAY declared End of War between the inhabitants of Anlos and his people. As a symbol, he gave his royal name “LAKLE” to Tay Eha (who is now his grandson in-law) that is known as Lakle Dormegbaba. Lakle Rikui. Appellatively hailed, Lakle Dormegbaba be ye dami wu gbor. LAKLE RIKUU, Ebe ye me nye Gbor deami gbor nu o. (the port-belly leopard or panther which says he is fatter than goat, a lean panther which says he is no where equal to a fatty goat.)  The marriage of TAY LAKLE EHA to MEGBENYA however, enable Tay to own LAKLE, and also resulted to the descendants of EHA ASHIAPIM to obtain land from the family of Amedor Kpeglah - the Bate king as well as land from the Tovie Clan. Tunu township belives the mangrove is their Cocoa, they grow it, and when the bush matured they cut it into uniform lengths and died them. When the logs are drenched off water, they then would tie a considerable volume and place a monitary value on a bundle. The one beauty of the business is that, each bundle appeared to be same in volume after they are tied. People from far buys the bundles and used them for cooking or other fires. It is a hard but lucretive business.

En y allant, il a posé son piège en fixant un fusil sur le chemin où les bêtes se déplacent ou passent quand elles errent.

        "<p class='p'>Les habitants d'Ada et d'Anlo ont une relation inhabituelle. Cette connexion a contribué à donner naissance au terme <u>Tunu</u>. Selon les récits, les habitants d'Ada étaient des pêcheurs. Mais ce n'est pas tout ; ils faisaient aussi de l'agriculture et du commerce avec les habitants d'Anlo de l'autre côté de la rivière Volta. À un moment donné, plusieurs d'entre eux se sont lancés dans la récolte de vin de palme. Voici ce qui s'est passé. La région de collecte a été découverte par les dirigeants du clan Klevie, un clan d'Anlo. Cela s'étendait jusqu'à Fuveme (Azizanu) et jusqu'à Dzita et au-delà.</p>"+
        "<br> Au fil du temps, les membres du clan Klevie ont donné des portions de la zone de collecte aux gens d'Ada et pendant un certain temps, ces résidents d'Ada ont planté des palmiers sur le site et ont utilisé pour récolter et brasser du vin à partir de la plantation de palmiers. <br>  Puis tout à coup, ils ont remarqué un vol de leur vin et ont accusé les gens du clan Klevi de voler leur vin.  En conséquence, ils ont utilisé leur divinité pour jeter un sort au clan Klevi. La situation est devenue tendue, donc, cela a pris un autre clan (<i class='p'>clan BATEH</i>) membres/anciens pour payer au nom du clan Klevi. Les gens de Klevie ont transféré la terre au clan Bateh à la suite de cette gentillesse du clan Bateh. Cet événement illustre comment les gens de Bateh contrôlent la zone de collecte. Plus tard, les animaux sauvages de la forêt ont posé problème, et lorsque cela est devenu important, la décision a été prise de les éliminer. Ainsi, un homme nommé <u>Agbahnyo</u> du peuple Bateh a sollicité le soutien de vaillants guerriers pour l'aider à exterminer les animaux sauvages. À ce stade, un chasseur de Srogboe-Wuti s'est approché et a proposé de faire le travail. <u class='p'>LAKLEH TAY EHA</u> était le nom de cet individu.</p><br>"+

        "<P>Un jour, il y a très longtemps, un homme appelé Papa Preku est allé chasser des animaux sauvages à cet endroit. C'était un chasseur. Les animaux dérangeaient sur cette colline. Donc, Preku a été envoyé par son partenaire Lakleh pour partir en expédition de chasse. En y allant, il a posé son piège en fixant un fusil sur le chemin où les bêtes se déplacent ou passent quand elles errent. Après avoir réglé son fusil, il grimperait dans un arbre et, à l'aide d'une corde, il tirerait la gâchette du fusil qu'il avait posé sur le sol sur les animaux depuis le sommet de l'arbre. <br> Il compléterait ensuite la mise à mort en tirant d'autres fusils et munitions qu'il avait avec lui au sommet de l'arbre. En peu de temps, tous les animaux dangereux, y compris les lions, ne dérangeaient plus, ils étaient éliminés. Cette bravoure a étonné tous les autres chasseurs et les gens car ils ont essayé en vain et ils se demandent comment il a fait. Par conséquent, ils lui demanderaient comment il a fait. <br> Et fièrement, Preku dirait (' Afisia la, Etunue wonye.'). Pour dire, '<i>cet endroit, c'est une bouche d'un fusil. Quand on essaie, on meurt.</i>' <br>Cette renommée a naturellement donné naissance au nom célèbre <span >Tunu.</span> <br> (à la bouche et au canon d'un fusil.)</P>"+

        "<p class='p'>Les habitants d'Ada et d'Anlo ont une relation inhabituelle. Cette connexion a contribué à donner naissance au terme <u>Tunu</u>. Selon les récits, les habitants d'Ada étaient des pêcheurs. Mais ce n'est pas tout ; ils faisaient aussi de l'agriculture et du commerce avec les habitants d'Anlo de l'autre côté de la rivière Volta. À un moment donné, plusieurs d'entre eux se sont lancés dans la récolte de vin de palme. Voici ce qui s'est passé. La région de collecte a été découverte par les dirigeants du clan Klevie, un clan d'Anlo. Cela s'étendait jusqu'à Fuveme (Azizanu) et jusqu'à Dzita et au-delà.</p>"+
        "<br> Au fil du temps, les membres du clan Klevie ont donné des portions de la zone de collecte aux gens d'Ada et pendant un certain temps, ces résidents d'Ada ont planté des palmiers sur le site et ont utilisé pour récolter et brasser du vin à partir de la plantation de palmiers. <br>  Puis tout à coup, ils ont remarqué un vol de leur vin et ont accusé les gens du clan Klevi de voler leur vin.  En conséquence, ils ont utilisé leur divinité pour jeter un sort au clan Klevi. La situation est devenue tendue, donc, cela a pris un autre clan (<i class='p'>clan BATEH</i>) membres/anciens pour payer au nom du clan Klevi. Les gens de Klevie ont transféré la terre au clan Bateh à la suite de cette gentillesse du clan Bateh. Cet événement illustre comment les gens de Bateh contrôlent la zone de collecte. Plus tard, les animaux sauvages de la forêt ont posé problème, et lorsque cela est devenu important, la décision a été prise de les éliminer. Ainsi, un homme nommé <u>Agbahnyo</u> du peuple Bateh a sollicité le soutien de vaillants guerriers pour l'aider à exterminer les animaux sauvages. À ce stade, un chasseur de Srogboe-Wuti s'est approché et a proposé de faire le travail. <u class='p'>LAKLEH TAY EHA</u> était le nom de cet individu.</p><br>"+

        "<p class='p'> <br> Lorsque Prehku est allé évaluer la région, lui et Lakleh ont conçu un plan de match qui a fonctionné. Après leur réussite, Agbanyo les a récompensés (les chasseurs) avec une part de la terre. Ils ont déménagé dans la zone en compagnie de Torgbui <u>Doe Sifu</u>. En raison du plan d'eau à proximité et pour pêcher, ils considèrent l'établissement comme un succès.</p><br> "+        "<h3 style='text-transform: uppercase;'>Compétences de Preku et le nom tunu.</h3>"+
