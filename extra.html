At the same time, a large force of Ewe warriors was advancing towards Anlo to help them fight the combined forces made up of English, Twi and Ga speaking people. Since the Anlos had already emerged victorious in the war, the Ewe force went into capturing the porters of the English merchants and taking their merchandise from them at places such as Agortime, Abutia, Ho, Anyirawase and PEKI areas. Of course this action of the Ewes remained a pain in the hearts of the British.  The then Governor of the Gold Coast based in Accra Marshaled a force of some 900 in addition to some 500 soldiers put together by the merchants as well as some 200 Indian troops. In all he had an army numbering about 1600 seasoned fighters whose orders included to 1. Bring the Ewes into Submission 2. Capture the Great Keta Lagoon and Take captive the commanders of the Ewe forces especially, GERALDO DE-LIMA and deliver them to the Governor in Accra. The invading forces crossed the Volta River at Mafi Adidome only to come up against a determined Mafi Force which would not allow them to cross their land to invade their neighbors. (<a href=''>SEE HOW THEY DID IT</a>) They held up the invaders in a battle lasting two days after which they received a request from the Anlo War General called Dzokoto to allow the invaders to cross such that they can then be surrounded by the Ewes. The Mafi Forces agreed to the request and therefore took a detour via Sasekpe, Gidikpi, Alorkpa-Sadame and Goxenu to reach Nugblebi. By this time the invading forces had arrived at a place mid-way between the Yaluvi and Torve after crossing the Red River *(Tordzie*). Even before other Ewe fighters could arrive, fighting had already broken out between the invaders and fighters from AVENOR, Mafi and Agave. Anlos soon arrived under the command of Dzokoto. A fierce battle ensued and there was evidence that things were going against the Ewe Forces made up of the Anlos, The Somes, Avenors, Mafi and Tongus who were under the command of Dzokoto. <a href=''>Awadada Axorlu</a> also said to the worriors that 'here stand and fight to the last, and any man who runs and reaches home alive must be ready to wear a woman's pant for the rest of his life'.  One of the wing commanders   on realizing that things were not going well for the Ewes swore an oath and declared that you do not scratch your back when you are itching on your chest and that something unprecedented would have to happen in this battle. He observed that while the enemies were armed to the teeth with guns and other deadly weapons, they, the Ewes, only had clubs, spears and bows and arrows to fight with. He therefore called for the Ewes to entrust the battle to the god of the thunder ⚡. Herein refers to as <i style='color:white;'>NYEGBLA</i> - (the god Ashiapim and brothers were made to bring from ADA.) He stamped his feet along with the invocation that 'metal must sound like *metal'*!. The thunder sounded at noon and was far louder than any bomb ever sounded. It resulted in a great fire 🔥 which reduced everything in its trail to ashes. Fighters of the invading Army, which was under the command of one General Humphrey, perished in great numbers in the fire🔥 🔥 🔥. Some of those that were left became instant hunchbacks while others became deaf and dumb. In effect the objective of the invaders to destroy the Ewes, capture the Keta Lagoon and indeed take some of their war Generals captive to the Governor failed woefully. The battle ground that became known as *Datsutagba*lies between <i style='color: white;'> AVENOR at TORVE, Akatsi and Xavi.</i> To this day, no grass or plants has ever grown here. <br> CREDIT: to Charles Kormi Kudzordzi Aka papavi Hogbedetor, whose book 📙 THE BATTLES AND WARS OF THE EWE PEOPLE , <a href='https://web.facebook.com/381760685687593/posts/the-datsutagba-war-of-1866the-brave-warriors-of-anlo-had-completely-defeated-an-/1063448090852179/?_rdc=1&_rdr'> the history</a> is from.</p>";

<!-- History of the coming of jawoe (RAA Nyegbla) to Keteklebi (ANLOGA)
Grandfather jahwoe RAA Nyegbla came to anloga in 1865. He is called by bokonorga Doe Akonu who is from the tovie clan. Doe Akonu travelled from nortsie to Keteklebi. Anloga.
He passed through  many places and finally passed through Tegbi before coming to the present day anloga.
He was told by his oracle to call the following people who were our grandparents.
The people are 
Ahiapim 
Kabutey
Asimasine (LE)
He asked them to fight against the people of Ada at atorkor, wuti and srorgboe
Because they do not allowed Keteklebi people to be fishing in their water territories at Azizanu(estuary)
Before that, Torgbi Deladzea, Torgbi  Amesimeku and Torgbi Dordi sent to them these items accordingly.
Torgbi Deladzea ………………………… gbadzagoli
 Torgbi  Amesimeku …………………… Ade3kpui (sword) and
Torgbi Dordi ……………………………… Alornuga
Jahwoe Raa Nyegbla and his sons were at Gbogbla NigoPrampam
When they were called to Keteklebi – Anloga in the 1865 war.
When he came, he defeated the people of Ada for the people of Anlo .
Making the Anlo people free to fish in the river Volta estuary. it was Tamekloe and Sorkpor who went to Azizanu and suppress the Ada people in a curse which enable the Anlo people to defeat the Ada  people.
On 6th march 1866, when another war broke out , Raa Nyegbla again defeated the people at Datsutagba war. He was given Mama Adesu deity to him for a wife.
Later on Tettevi Amivor took  the wife Awusuto his home and told the people of enlo that  he has taken  Nyigbla with him.
Tamekloe further  decided to move back to the Kwamufie his former home town.
But the people of Anlo however	 denied his leaving. Kukpo went to Sri Kofi Hayibor Aziza Kwakume came onto the throne. This king told his priest –Agortsimevi Kugblenu to stop using the white cloth because he shall also stop using ‘Agagadama ade wu’ dodo. 
He too obeyed this command and staeted to use “BISI” cloth which was not allowed in Jahwoe RAA Nyegbla house.
Our chiefs mamma wo and the people of Anlo (Keteklebi) here is the history of  Jahwoe RAA Nyegbla.
Thanks
Asiapim Nyegbla  -->
